## How it works:
- Write your weapon's name
- Click some buttons
- Copy and paste into an XML file
- Done!

## Known issues:
- `<defaultProjectile>` doesn't update when renaming `<defName>`.

## To-do:
- Reduce code size, make it DRY
- Test, a lot
- Make preview window bigger
- Texture preview?
- Melee?
