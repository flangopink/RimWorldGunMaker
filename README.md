## How it works:
- Write your weapon's name and description
- Click some buttons
- Copy and paste into an XML file
- Done!

## Known issues:
- Values don't update when manually entering them. Only when pressing Enter or changing focus.
- `CompClass` for oversized weapons should be removed.

## To-do:
- Test, ***a lot***
- Automatically make patches for other mods (CE, Proper Shotguns, Multiplayer, etc)
- Creating mod folders, files, about.xml, etc?
  - Texture preview?
- Melee?
- Apparel??
